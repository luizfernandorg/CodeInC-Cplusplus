/*
A C++ Programs go through six phases: Edit, Preprocess, Compile, Link,
load and execute.
1) Edit:
        Edit the file(Source code) in the text editor or IDE extensions used by the 
        source code: .cpp, .cxx, .cc, .C (C in uppercase to indicate this is a C++ file) 
        in the compiler documentation there is an explanation for which extension it use.
2) Preprocessing:
        Preprocessing are directives given by the source code to the compiler, that indicates some manipulations are necessary
        Like the #include directive that indicates to the compiler to replace that directive by the source code in headers and C++ code
3) Compile:
        Converte a C++ source code to an Object
4) Linking:
        In the link process all the headers and source codes, used in the project, are put together to generate one single 
        the file that is the program itself, and executable software
5) Load:
        When the program is load, it is put in memory and also the libraries used by the software.
6) Execute:
        The CPU executes the program one instruction at a time. Some errors can occur in some moments than is a need to edit the code e go through all the processes again.
        C++ have to input and output data, to input data, use the std::cin >> ... (directing normally to keyboard, but can be redirected to another device)
        C++ output data using the std::cout << ... (normally the keyboard, but also can redirect to another device) to print an error can be used std::cerr


When the program runs then an error occurs is called a "Runtime Error" or "Execution-Time Error"
        
"Fatal Runtime Error" cause program to crash(terminate)


"Nonfatal Runtime Error", the program executes but with some possible wrong results


std is a namespace in C++ and cout, cin and cerr are names that belong to std namespace
this way to use one of those names we need to do this:


        std::cout
        std::cin
        std::cerr


but using the keyword using we can avoid use std::cout, like so:
        using namespace std;  //Using diretive
or:
        using std::cout; // Using declaration;


but is a good practice not use this, because if you have more than one namespace with the same name inside
this could cause a problem, so try to use always namespace::name like std::cout;


Escape sequence
\n                a new line
\t                a horizontal tab
\r                Carriage return, position the cursor to the current line
\a                Alert, sound the system bell
\\                scape a \ on screen
\'                scape a single quote
\"                scape a double qoute


the return statement in the final the main function is optional


Use identifiers of 31 characters or fewer to ensure portability.


Do not use identifiers that begin with underscores and double underscores, the compiler may use a similar identifier.


Avoid using abbreviations in identifiers. This improves program readability.


some fundamental types: double, bool, int, char


the std::cin, is a standard input stream object cin of namespace std


and the stream extraction operator >> obtain the value inside the variable positioned on the right side of the operator.


Using multiple stream insertion operators (<<) in a single statement is referred to as concatenating, chaining or cascading stream insertion operations.


The stream insertion operator << insert the value on the right’s side of the operator.


the assigment operator “=” on “int number1 = 0;” assign the value 0 to number1.


the “=” and “+” operator is called a binary operator.


Using multiple stream insertion operators (<<) in a single statement is referred to as concatenating, chaining, or cascading stream insertion operations.
when a value is placed in a variable it replaces the previous value, this is called a “destructive” operation.


“nondestructive” operation occurs when the value is read from the memory.




Arithmetic operations:


Operation                       Arithmetic      Algebriac                C++ 
                                Operator        Expression               Expression


Addition                        +                 f + 7                   f + 7
Subtraction                     -                 p – c                   p - c
Multiplication                  *                 bm or b ⋅ m              b * m
Division                        /                 x / y or or x ÷ y        x / y
Modulus                         %                 r mod s                  r % s


The modulus operator “%” only can be used with integers operands. The expression x%y yields
the remainder after x is divided by y.


Precedence of Operators:
1º Parentheses are evaluated first.
2º Multiplication, division, and modulus operations are applied next.
3º Addition and subtraction operations are applied last.


Operator(s) in order of evaluation (precedence)
( )
*
/
%
+
-

Relational Operators:
>
<
>=
<=

Equality Operators:
==
!=

A compound statement or block is when creating one or more statements inside the brackets {...}

some programmers use the directive “using” as in “using namespace std” to use all the names inside std namespace inside of the “iostream” header

Operator Precedence:
()
/ * %
+ -
<< >>
< <= > >=
== !=
=

the  “static_cast<type>(value)” gives us the converted type of value

### 3.1 - Introduction to Classes

### 3.2 Defining a class with a member function

        //in the class name, the first letter of each word is written with a capital letter
        class GradeBook{ // class definition
        public: // here is define a public specifier block, everything that follows bellow is a public member of the class
                // this function member, has a camel case style on its name, the second word has the first letter in capital
                void gradeMessage() const // this line is commonly referred as a function header
                                        // the method follow by the const keyword indicates to compiler 
                                        //that this method doesn't modify the object, like properties for example
                {
                        std::cout << "Grade Message" << std::endl;
                }
        };
        const objects can only call const members

                const GradeBook g;  // the GradeBook here is a user-defined type
                GradeBook.gradeMessage()

        to call a method member of a class is necessary to create an object of it, static members are an exception

### 3.3 Defining a Member Function with a Parameter

        You can define new class types as needed; this is one reason why C++ is known as an "extensible programming language".

        #include <string>
                std::string var;
        std::getline( stream, var); stream is the origin of caracters ex. std::cin, and the var is where to store the whole line 

        we call the method displayMessage(var) passing the course name to the method, copying the value stored in the variable var
        the method displayMessage(std:string nameOfCourse); receives a copied string as a parameter

        ### 3.4 Data Members, set Member Functions and get Member Functions

        variables declared in the class, are called "data members"

        const function member only can call internally const functions member
        set function member is known as mutators because they change the value of a property
        get function member are call as accessors

### 3.5 - Initializating Objects with Contructors
        constructor need to have the same name of the class definition
        make research for explanation about explicit keyword?
        ...
        public:
                explicit GradeBook(std::string name) : courseName(name) {}
        ...
        the : followed by the name of data member with the parameter name inside parentheses to Initialize the data member

### 3.6 Placing a Class in a Separate File for Reusability
        to Reusability of the class is commonly to define the class inside a header file.
        headers can use the using keyword, this why is always use std::

        Additional Software Engineering Issues
            It's a good practice to put a class inside a header file only with the member variable and functions's declaration 
            and the members function definitions put into another cpp file 
            
            ## GradeBook.h
            class GradeBook{
                std::string courseName; 
            public: 
                // the constructor here use a member-initializer list, there is a ":" followed by the class's data-member with the new value for it
                // surrounded by parenthesis
                // this tells to the compiler that only is acceptable to explicit ...
                explicit GradeBook(std::string name);
            
                // bellow is defined all the object’s member functions that will be public
                void setCourseName(std::string name);
                std::string getCourseName() const;
                void displayMessage() const;
            };
            
            ## GradeBook.cpp
            #include <iostream>
            #include <string>
            #include "GradeBook.h"
            
            // bellow is defined all the object’s member functions that will be public
            
            //constructor
            GradeBook::GradeBook(std::string name): courseName(name) {}
            
            //member functions
            void GradeBook::setCourseName(std::string name){
                courseName = name;
            }
            std::string GradeBook::getCourseName() const {
                return courseName;
            }
            void GradeBook::displayMessage() const {
                std::cout << "Welcome to the grade book for " << getCourseName() << "!" << std::endl;
            }
### 4 Control Statements: Part I: Assigment, ++ and -- operators
    Before writing code we must have thorough understanding of the problem, and carefully planned approach to solving it.
    When writing a program, we must also understand the available building blocks and employ proven program construction thechniques.
    
    ## 4.3 Pseudocode
        Pseudocode normally describe only executable statements
        int counter; is not an executable statement
        
        Some programmers choose to list variables and mention their pruposes at the begnning of pseudocode
        
        Example of pseudocode:
            1 Prompt the user to enter the first interger
            2 input the first interger
            3
            4 Prompt the user to enter the second interger
            5 input the second integer
            6
            7 Add first integer and second integer, and store the results
            8 Display result
        
        programs could be written in terms of only three control structures(control statements), namely:
            sequence structure
            selection structure
            repeticion structure
            
        sequence structure is built in C++, the statements are executed in sequence.
        
        UML:
            Active Diagram is an UML resource, and model the Workflow/activity, and include a portion of algorithm, such as the sequence structure
            
            Active Diagram are composed of special-purpose symbols, such as Action State Symbols (a rectangle with its left and right sides replaced with
            arcs curving outward), Diamonds and Small Circles these symbols are connected by Transition Arrows, which represent the flow of the activity
            
            Action States represent the actions to perform and each Action State contains Action Expression, ex. "add grade to total", "add 1 to counter"
            
            The arrow represent Transition
            
            A Solid Circle represent the flow start and the end.
            
            Can be used of UML notes to show a representation in C++ and is connected to the Action State by Dotted Line
            
        Selection Statements
            
            if (single-selection statement), if...else (double-selection statement), switch (multiple-selection statement)
            The if statement is a single-entry/single-exit statement
            
            Forms:
                if(condition)
                    //block of one single line
                
                if(condition){
                    //block of multiple lines
                }
                
                if(condition){
                    //block executed if is true
                } else {
                    //block executed if is condition false    
                }
                
                if(condition){
                    // true block
                } else if (condition){
                    // true block
                } else if (condition) {
                    // true block
                } 
                ...
                else {
                    // block executed if any other options is true
                }
                
                if(condition){
                    ; // as know as null-statement or empty-statement
                }else{
                    // block will executed if condition is false
                }
            ex. of a pseudocode for if statement
            
                if student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
                    print "Passed"
                
                in C++:
                
                    if(grade >= 60)
                        std::cout << "Passed" << std::endl;
                
                If student’s grade is greater than or equal to 60
                    Print “Passed”
                Else
                    Print “Failed”
                
                in C++:
                    if(grade >= 60)
                        std::cout << "Passed" << std::endl;
                    else
                        std::cout << "Failed" << std::endl;
            
            switch will be studied after
        
        Repetition Statements in C++
            
            while, do...while, for
            
            while(condition){
                //block will be executed if the condition is true
            }
            
            do {
                // execute at least once
                // and then if the condition is true
            } while(condition);
            
            for(initiation; condition; incremention/decremention){
                // block is executed if condition is true
            }
            
            ex. of while:
                in pseudocode:
                    while there are more items on my shopping list
                        purchase next item and cross it off my list
                in C++
                    int product = 3;
                    
                    while ( product <= 100 )
                        product = 3 * product
                
        those control statements can be combined in a control-statement stacking or control-statement nesting

        4.8 Formulating Algorithms: counter-controlled repetition
        
            Problem Statement:
                A class of ten students took a quiz. The grades (0 to 100) for this quiz are available to you.
                Calculate and display the total of the grades and the class average
                
                average is equal to the sum of the grades divided by the number of students
                
                a counter-controlled repetition(definite repetition) uses a counter to controle the number of time the block will be executed

                4 While grade counter is less than or equal to ten
                5       Prompt the user to enter the next grade
                6       Input the next grade
                7       Add the grade into the total
                8       Add one to the grade counter
                9   
                10 Set the class overage to the total divided by ten
                11 Print the total of the grades for all students in the class
                12 Print the class average

            a sentinel value is used to stop the while loop, and it is also know as "signal value", a "dummy value" or a "flag value"

                First refinement:
                    (1) Initialize variables
                    (2) Input, sum and count the quiz grades

                            Prompt the user to enter the first grade
                            Input the first grade (possible the sentinel)
                            
                            While the user has not yet entered the sentiel
                                Add this grade into the running total
                                Add one to the grade counter

                            If the counter is not equal to zero
                                Set the average to the total divided by the counter

                    Initialize counter to zero
                    
                    Prompt the user to enter the first grade
                    Input the first grade (possibly the sentinel)
                    
                    While the user has not yet entered the sentinel
                        Add this grade into the running total

                    If the counter is not equal to zero
                        Set the average to the total divided by the counter
                        Print the total of the grades for all students in the class
                        Print the class average
                    else

                Always prevent possible errors by testing the input before storing in the variables, for example, to avoid division by zero
                
            float is single-precision floating-point numbers, having approximately seven significant digits today
            double is double-precision floating-point numbers, having approximately 15 significant digits today,
            this requires twice as much memory as float variables
            
            floating-point values are known as floating-point literals
            The computer allocates only a fixed amount of space to hold such a value
            
            depend on the program we can use float variable instead of double because we'll not need such precision after the decimal point
            but in a program that needs such precision double is preferred
            
            static_cast<double>(total) is called as explicit conversion
            when we divide an int and double, an implicit convertion of int to double occurs
            
            static_cast is an unary operator cause use only one operator
            
            setprecision is referred as "parameterized stream manipulator"
            setprecision is in <iomanip> header
            
            endl is a nonparameterized stream manipulator, because it isn’t followed by a value or expression in parentheses
            
            The stream manipulator std::fixed indicates that floating-point values should be output in so-called fixed-point format, as opposed to scientific notation.
            Scientific notation for 1.0 and 10.0 multiplied by a power of 10 is show as 1.0x10^1, 3,100.0 = 3.1x10^3
            
            when the std::fixed and std::setprecision are used in a program the printed value is rounded to the number of decimal positions indicated by the value passed to std::setprecision
            in the case setprecision is set to 2 the value 87.946 is output as 87.95 and 67.543 as 67.54

            std::showpoint is a manipulator, and in combination with std::fixed will force the decimal point to appear, both are in <iostream> header
            
        4.10 Formulating Algorithms: Nested Control Statements
            
            Consider the follwing problem statement:
                A college offers a course that prepares students for the state licensing exam for real state
                broker. Last year, ten of the students who completed this course took the exam.
                The college wants to know how well its students did on the exam. You've been asked to
                write a program to summarize the results. You've been given a list of these 10 students.
                Next to each name is written a 1 if the student passed the exam or a 2 if the student failed.
                
            Your program should analyze the results of the exam as follows:
                1. Input each test result (i.e., a 1 or a 2). Display the prompting message "Enter result" each
                   time the program requests another test result.
                2. Count the number of test results of each type.
                3. Display a summary of the test results indicating the number of students who passed and the number who failed
                4. If more than eitht students passed the exam, print the message "Bonus to instructor!"
                
            After reading the problem statement carefully, we make the following observations:
            	1. The program must process test results for 10 students. A counter-controlled loop
            	   can be used because the number of test results is known in advance
            	2. Each test result is a number - either a 1 or a 2. Each time the program reads a test
            	   result, the program must determine whether the number is a 1 or a 2. For simplicity, 
            	   we test only for a 1 in our algorithm. If the number is not a 1, we assume that it's a 2
            	   (Please be sure to do Exercise 4.20, which considers the consequences of this assumption.)
            	3. Two counters are used to keep track of the exam results - one to count the number of students
            	   who passed the exam and one to count the number of students who failed the exam.
            	4. After the program has processed all the results, it must decide whether more than eight students
            	   passed the exam.

            unary decrement operator --
            
            ++a     Increment by 1, then use the new value of a in the expression in which a resides
            a++     Use the current value of a in the expression which a resides, then increment a by 1
            --a     Decrement by 1, then use the new value of a in the expression in which a resides
            a--     Use the current value of a in the expression which a resides, then decrement a by 1
            
            Preincrement or Predecrement ++a or --a, --a => --/++ is prefixed
            Postincrement or Postdecrement a++ or a--,  a-- => --/++ is postfixed
            
            unsing pre or post increment and decrement operators in the statement have the same logic effect
            but in expressions, we should be careful because can cause different results

            a) All programs can be written in terms of three types of control structures: "Sequence", "selection" and "repetition".
            b) The "if...else" selection statement is used to execute one action when a condition is true
            or a different action when that condition is false.
            c) Repeating a set of instructions a specific number of times is called "counter-controlled or definitive" repetition.
            d) When it isn’t known in advance how many times a set of statements will be repeated,
            a(n) "Sentinel, signal, flag or dummy" value can be used to terminate the repetition.

### 5 for Repetition Statement
    off-by-one errors occur when we use wrongly < instead <= for example when we want to count from 1 to 10, and showing only 1 to 9
        for(unsigned int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
            std::cout << i << " ";

    for ( initialization; loopContinuationCondition; increment )
        statement

    initialization;
    while ( loopContinuationCondition )
    {
        statement
        increment;
    }

    different ways to increment:
        counter = counter + 1
        counter += 1
        ++counter
        counter++
    
    loop for can contain arithmetic expressions
        unsigned int x = 2;
        unsigned int y = 10;

        for ( unsigned int j = x; j <= 4 * x * y; j += y / x )

        or can be expressed this way

        for ( unsigned int j = 2; j <= 80; j += 5 )

    to count downward should use decrement operator --x, x--

    avoid change the vairable used in for loop from the for body.

    Variety of for-loop uses
        a) Vary the control variable from 1 to 100 in increments of 1.
        
            for ( unsigned int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i )
        
        b) Vary the control variable from 100 down to 0 in decrements of 1. Notice that we
           used type int for the control variable in this for header. The condition does not
           become false until control variable i contains -1, so the control variable must be
           able to store both positive and negative numbers.
            
            for ( int i = 100; i >= 0; --i )
        
        c) Vary the control variable from 7 to 77 in steps of 7.
            
            for ( unsigned int i = 7; i <= 77; i += 7 )

        d) Vary the control variable from 20 down to 2 in steps of -2.

            for ( unsigned int i = 20; i >= 2; i -= 2 )
        
        e) Vary the control variable over the following sequence of values: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17.

            for ( unsigned int i = 2; i <= 17; i += 3 )

        f) Vary the control variable over the following sequence of values: 99, 88, 77, 66, 55.

            for ( unsigned int i = 99; i >= 55; i -= 11 )
        
    Do not use != or == in test in a for loop because if the for loop in the increment phase steps by 2
    can cause logic error and infinit loop
    
    Application: Compound Interest Calculations
        A person invests $1000.00 in a savings account yielding 5 percent interest. Assuming
        that all interest is left on deposit in the account, calculate and print the amount of
        money in the account at the end of each year for 10 years. Use the following formula
        for determining these amounts:
        a = p ( 1 + r )n
        where
            p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal),
            r is the annual interest rate,
            n is the number of years and
            a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year.
    
    #include <iomanip>
        std::setw(4) // will set 4 spaces to the field
        std::cout << std::setw(4) << year << std::setw(21) << amount << std::endl;
            1             1050.00

        ==      a == b  -a is equal b
        !=      a != b  -a is not equal to b

    Structured programming result in three froms of control:
        Sequence    - line by line
        Selection   - if, if..else, switch
        Repetition  - do..while, for, while
    
    Exercises:
        5.1 State whether the following are true or false. If the answer is false, explain why.
            a) The default case is required in the switch selection statement.
                False The default case is optional. Nevertheless, it’s considered good software engineering
                to always provide a default case.
            b) The break statement is required in the default case of a switch selection statement to
            exit the switch properly.
                True
            c) The expression ( x > y && a < b ) is true if either the expression x > y is true or the
            expression a < b is true.
                False the && operator sets that left and right tests should be true to evaluate true
            d) An expression containing the || operator is true if either or both of its operands are
            true.
                True
        5.2 Write a C++ statement or a set of C++ statements to accomplish each of the following:
            a) Sum the odd integers between 1 and 99 using a for statement. Use the unsigned int
            variables sum and count.

            b) Print the value 333.546372 in a 15-character field with precisions of 1, 2 and 3. Print
            each number on the same line. Left-justify each number in its field. What three values
            print?
            c) Calculate the value of 2.5 raised to the power 3 using function pow. Print the result with
            a precision of 2 in a field width of 10 positions. What prints?
                std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2);
                std::cout << std::setw(10) << std::pow(2.5,3)
            d) Print the integers from 1 to 20 using a while loop and the unsigned int counter variable
            x. Print only 5 integers per line. [Hint: When x % 5 is 0, print a newline character; otherwise,
            print a tab character.]
            e) Repeat Exercise 5.2(d) using a for statement.

### 6 Functions and an Introduction to Recursion
    To promote software reusability, every function should be limited to performing a single,
        well-defined task, and the name of the function should express that task effectively.

        6.10 Storage Classes and Storage Duration

            The attributes of variables include name, type, size and value. Each identifier in a program also has other attributes,
            including "storage duration", scope and "linkage"

            C++ provides five "storage-class specifiers" that determine a variable’s storage duration:
            "register", "extern", "mutable" and "static".

            "mutable" is used exclusively with classes
            "thread_local" is used with multithread applications

            Storage Duration
                An identifier’s storage duration determines the period during which that identifier exists in memory.
                Some exist briefly, some are repeatedly created and destroyed and others exist for a program’s entire execution
                An identifier’s storage-class specifier helps determine its storage duration and linkage.
                Four storage durations: automatic, static, dynamic and thread

                Some storage durations "static" and "automatic"
            Scope
                An identifier's scope is where the identifier can be referenced in a program. 
                        - Throughout a program
                        - A limited portion of a program
            Linkage
                An identifier's linkage determine if the declaration is known in the source file or across multiple files and then
                the linker put them together.
            
            Local Variables and Automatic Storage Duration
                - Local variables declare in functions
                - function parameters
                - local variables or function parameters declared with register
                
                Local variables has automatic storage duration, also call as automatic variables
            
            Register Variables:
                The compiler might ignore register declarations. For example, there might not be a
                sufficient number of registers available.

                    register unsigned int counter = 1;

                The definition suggests that the unsigned int variable counter be placed in one of the computer’s registers; 
                regardless of whether the compiler does this, counter is initialized to 1:

                The register keyword can be used only with local variables and function parameters.
                Often, register is unnecessary. Today’s optimizing compilers can recognize frequently
                used variables and may place them in registers without needing a register declaration.

            Static Storage Duration
                Keywords "extern" and "static" declare identifiers for variables with static storage duration and for functions
                Variables with static storage duration exist int memory from the point at which the program begins execution and
                util the program terminates
            
            Identifiers with Static Storage Duration
                there are two types of identifiers:
                    - external identifiers ( such as global variables )
                    - local variables
                both declared with storage-class identifier static

                avoid use global variables because that could cause problemas if some function change the value of it
                variables should be declare inside of a function stead global

            static Local Variables
                
                static unsigned int count = 1;

                static variables retain their value even when the function ends e return to the caller if the function is 
                called again the static variable still have the last value from when the function was called.
                it's a good practice initilized all the variables
                storage-class specifiers
                    extern
                    static
                They have special meaning when they're applied explicity to external identifiers such as global variables and global
                function names

            Scope Rules
                block scope  
                        variables declared inside {...} in a function and function parameter,
                        are accessed inside a nested block inside the function
                        static variables have block scope, exist since program begins
                function scope
                        - start:
                        - case in switch statement
                global namespace scope
                        Global variables, function definitions and function prototypes placed outside a function all have 
                        global namespace scope.
                function-prototype scope
                        identifiers used in function parameters in a function-prototype, those no necessary need a name for the prameters
                        only on function's definition.
                class scope
                namespace scope

        6.14 Inline Functions
            Inline function the compiler put the body content on the place the function is being called

                inline double cube( const double );

        6.15 References and Reference Parameters
            A reference parameter is an alias for its corresponding argument in a function call
                
                int& cube

        6.16 Default Arguments
            Default values are set in the prototype or when the definition is the prototype, but if is provided a prototype
            the default values are declared in the prototype, and the definition look like this without default values:
                
                // Prototype declaration
                unsigned int boxVolume( unsigned int length = 1, unsigned int width = 1, unsigned int height = 1 );
                
                // Definition
                unsigned int boxVolume( unsigned int length, unsigned int width, unsigned int height ){
                    return length * width * height;
                }

        6.17 Unary Scope Resolution Operator (::)
            int a = 12;
            int main(){
                int a = 22;
                std::cout << ::a << " " << a << std::endl;
            }
            > 12 22

        6.18 Function Overloading
            function overloading happens when functions have the same name but have different signatures
        
        6.19 Function Templates
            template < typename T >
            T functionName( T value ){
                retrun value * value
            }
        
            C++11—Trailing Return Types for Functions (->)
               template < typename T >
               auto maximum( T x, T y, T z ) -> T
        
        6.20 Recursion
            it's a function that calls itself
        
            unsigned long int               - 4 bytes (32 bits) - 0 -> 4,294,967,295
            long int                        - 4 bytes (32 bits) - –2,147,483,647 -> 2,147,483,647

                fibonacci(0) = 0
                fibonacci(1) = 1
                fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n – 1) + fibonacci(n – 2)

            Performace Tip:
                Avoid Fibonacci-style recursive programs that result in an exponential “explosion” of calls.
        
        6.22 Recursion vs. Iteration
            Any problem that can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively

            Performance Tip 6.9
                Avoid using recursion in performance situations. Recursive calls take time and consume additional memory.
